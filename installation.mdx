    <Info>
    This is an officially supported package, maintained by a member of the Sherlock Project itself.
    </Info>

    <Note>
    Sherlock has out-of-the-box support for Fedora, but support for Enterprise Linux is through [EPEL 8](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/#_el8).

    Enterprise Linux distributions are RHEL, CentOS, Alma, Rocky, Oracle, and Scientific.
    </Note>

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install sherlock-project
    ```

    That's it! You can now run sherlock from anywhere.

    ```bash
    sherlock --version
    ```

  <Tab title="BlackArch">

  <Tab title="Docker">
    ```bash
    docker pull sherlock/sherlock
    ```
<Note>Sherlock doesn't yet have context detection. It's recommended that Docker containers be ran with option `-o /opt/sherlock/results/{user123}.txt` (replace `{user123}`) when an output file is desired at the mounted volume (as seen in the compose). This has no effect on stdout, which functions as expected out of the box.</Note>

```bash
# One-off searches
docker run --rm -t sherlock/sherlock user123

# If you need to save the output file... (modify as needed)
# Output file will land in ${pwd}/results
docker run --rm -t -v "$PWD/results:/opt/sherlock/results" sherlock/sherlock -o /opt/sherlock/results/text.txt user123
```

```bash
# At any time, you may update the image via this command
docker pull sherlock/sherlock
```

### Using compose

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  sherlock:
    container_name: sherlock
    image: sherlock/sherlock
    volumes:
      - ./sherlock/:/opt/sherlock/results/
```

```bash
docker compose run sherlock user123
```

### Build image from source (useful for contributors)

```bash
# Assumes ${pwd} is repository root
docker build -t sherlock .
docker run --rm -t sherlock user123
```

  <Tab title="GitHub">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock.git
    cd sherlock
    virtualenv .
    source bin/activate
    ```

    ## Build live package from source (useful for contributors)

    Building an editable (or live) package links the entry point to your current directory, rather than to the standard install location. This is often useful when working with the code base, as changes are reflected immediately without reinstallation.

    Note that the version number will be 0.0.0 for pipx local builds unless manually changed in the pyproject file (it will prompt the user for an update).

    ```bash
    pipx install -e .
    ```

    ## Run package from source (without installing)

    If you'd rather not install directly to your system, you can import the module at runtime with -m.

    ```bash
    python3 -m sherlock user123 user789
    ```
